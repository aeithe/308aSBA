# SBA 308A - API 

- Used FETCH API to communicate with an external web api (digimon API). Used the data provided by this API to populate the content of my webpage.
- Created user interaction with the API through a search feature - which uses GET requests to pull data from the API.
- Made use of Promises/Await/Async to pull data from API
- Organized Javascript files into three module files and exported/imported code as necessary.
- Customized the HTML/CSS for a more aesthetic look.
- Program runs without errors so long as the name is typed correctly and with the first letter being capital (have tried to use .charAt(0).toUpperCase() but it doesn't change anything).
